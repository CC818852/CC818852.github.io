# About Me
Hello! I am CC.
Being a professional baseball player was my top choice. It connects to my lifestyle goals because my goal has always been to make it to the mlb and to be good at that level. I will be mentally stronger since baseball is one of the toughest mental jobs there is. I will also be fit because you need to work out and be active in baseball, this will help me stay fit.
